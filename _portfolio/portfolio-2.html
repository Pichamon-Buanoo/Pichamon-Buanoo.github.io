This is a mini-project for the Introduction to Python course, titled: How To Cluster Joint Sets: A K-Means Streamlit Approach.

This is a Python application designed to automatically classify joint sets using the K-Means clustering algorithm, an Unsupervised Machine Learning method for grouping data.

The application is built to divide the orientation data into K groups (Joint Sets) and plot the results on a Stereonet, featuring the following capabilities:

# Key Features

Platform: Runs as a web application (using the Streamlit library).

Data Input: Accepts .csv or .xlsx files containing Dip Direction and Dip Angle values.

Clustering Control: Allows the user to select the number of groups (the K-value).

Plot Type Selection: Users can choose between plotting the data as Poles or Planes.

Customization: Supports changing the plot's Font style.

Export 1 (Visualization): Enables downloading the generated Stereonet plot image.

Export 2 (Data): Allows exporting the original data with the new Joint Set labels added as a .csv file.

# Objective

The primary objective is to aid in the grouping of joint or fracture data through computational analysis. This approach prevents errors arising from manual polygon picking and significantly reduces processing time. The resulting classified joint set file (.csv) can then be seamlessly used as input for subsequent stereonet plotting or analysis applications.
