### Introduction
Stereographic projection is a widely used tool in various geological applications, including structural geology, failure analysis, and borehole interpretation. When working with a large number of dip-direction and dip-angle measurements from a study area, grouping the data into meaningful joint sets often requires mathematical computation or manual classification by the interpreter.

Therefore, I aimed to explore Python-based methods to automatically classify joint sets by importing data from a .csv file and generating stereonet visualizations with color-coded clusters.
